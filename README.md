# Introduction
Intersect is free and modern 2D MMORPG Maker. This engine was designed by developers active with similar engines of the past including Eclipse, Elysium, Mirage, and Xtremeworlds. Those engines have stopped receiving updates, their framework is nearly 2 decades old, and their support communities have died out. Intersect is our attempt to bring back the classic orpg elements from those engines with a modern code base and an extremely user friendly environment.
